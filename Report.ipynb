    "In the highly competitive telecommunication industry, customer churn prediction has emerged as a critical strategy for maintaining a loyal customer base and ensuring long-term profitability. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where subscribers discontinue their services with a telecom provider, either by switching to a competitor or ceasing to use the service altogether. Given the significant costs associated with acquiring new customers compared to retaining existing ones, accurately predicting and mitigating customer churn is essential for telecom companies.\n",
